# Chrome for Android Remote Debugging

Remote debugging with Chrome on Android is awesome but the command to start it is not. Read this first: https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/debugging and then run:

    $ npm install -g crd

Make sure you've enabled remote debugging, and Chrome on the phone is launched. Then simply run:

    $ crd

(This script also assumes Chrome as your default browser and that you are running OS X.) Patches welcome!
